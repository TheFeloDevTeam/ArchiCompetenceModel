    documentation="Management is a system that includes leadership, administration, policies, performance measures and incentives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This layer cultivates, coordinates and controls all other asset types.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Management includes idiosyncratic elements such as philosophy, core beliefs, values, decision-making style and perceptions of risk. It is also the most distinctive and inimitable type of asset deeply rooted in the organization.&#xD;&#xA;The term organization is used here to refer the enterprise or firm rather than the organization asset type. The most likely manner in which management assets can be partially extracted from an organization is by the poaching of key individuals who were instrumental in defining and developing a particular management system.&#xD;&#xA;Service management itself is a type of specialized management asset like others such as Project Management, Research and Development, and Manufacturing Management.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
